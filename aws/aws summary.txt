You are a developer for a genomics firm that is moving its infrastructure to AWS. Their environment 
consists of a three-tier web application, a web tier, an application tier and a relational database tier.
They have a separate fleet of virtual machines that are used to access large HPC clusters on the fly. 
Their lab researches run multiple projects simultaneously and they will need to launch and 
decommission 1,000's of nodes on-demand while reducing the time required to complete genomic sequencing 
from weeks to days. In order to stay competitive they need to do this at as low cost as possible, 
with no long-term contracts. These HPC clusters can run any time day or night and their workloads
store information in S3, so the instances can be terminated at any time without any effect on the data.
What is the most COST EFFECTIVE EC2 pricing model for their requirements?



You run the internal intranet for a corporate bank. The intranet consists of a number of webservers and single relational database running Microsoft SQL Server. Your peak demand occurs at 9am every week morning when users are first logging in to the intranet. They can only log in using the company's internal network and it is not possible to access the intranet from any location other than within the office building for security purposes. Management is considering a change and to move this environment to AWS where users will be able to access the intranet via a software VPN. You have been asked to evaluate a migration to AWS and to identify the best EC2 billing model for your company's intranet. You must keep costs low and to be able to scale at particular times of day. You must maintain availability of the intranet throughout office hours. Management do not want to be locked into any contracts in case for some reason they want to go back to hosting internally. What EC2 billing model should you recommend?


You are the IT manager at a furniture retailer and they are considering moving their web application to AWS. They currently colocate their servers in a colocation facility and the contract for this facility is now coming to an end.

Amazon DynamoDB
================

Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond 
performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multiregion, multimaster, durable database
with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications.
DynamoDB can handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and can support peaks 
of more than 20 million requests per second.


Hundreds of thousands of AWS customers have chosen DynamoDB as their key-value and document
database for mobile,web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and other applications that need low-latency
data access at any scale. Create a new table for your application and let DynamoDB handle the rest.



Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NOSQL database service for all apllications that
need consistent,single digit millisecond latency at any scale.It is fully manged databse
and supports both document and key value data models.It's a flexible data model and
reliable performance make it great fit for mobile,web gaming,IOT and many other serverless applications.

Serverless

Stored on SSD(solid state disk) storage
Spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers

 Choice of 2 consistency models
         1.Eventual consistent read (Default) (1 second)
         2.Strongly Consistent Reads   

Tables
 Items(Think a row of data in a table)
 Attributes(Think a column of a data in a table)
 Supports key-value and document data structure
 Key-The name of the data Value-Data itself
 Documents can be written in JSON,HTML or XML


DynamoDB stores and retrieves the data based on primary key
 2  types of primary key
  1. Partition Key -unique attribute (userid/employee id)
   Value of the partition key is input to an internal hash function which determines 
   the partition or physical location oon which data is stored.
   If you are using partition key as a primary key then no two items can have the same
   partition key

  2.Composite Key (Partition Key +Sort Key) in combination
     Ex.Same user posting multiple times to a forum
     Primary key would be composite key consisting of 
      Partition key (user id )        
      Sort Key (Time stamp of the post)
      2 items may have same partition key but they must have different sort key
      All items with same partition key are stored together according to the sort key       value
      allows you to store multiple items with same partition key


Authentication and Access Control is managed using AWS IAM
You can creat an IAM user within your AWS account which has specific permissions to access and create DynamoDB tables

You can create an IAM role which enables u to obtaine a tempraray access keys which can be used to access DyanmoDB 

You can also use special IAM Condition to restrict user access to only their own records

   IAM conditions Example

Imagine a mobile gaming application with millinos of users
Users need to access the hig scores of each game ther are playing
Access must be restricted to ensure they cannot view anyone else data
This can be done by adding a condition to an IAM policy to allow only to 
items where the partiition  key value  matches userid     
        

Fine grained access control using IAM condition parameter to 
dynamodb:LeadingKeys to allow users to access only the items where the 
partiition  key value  matches userid     
        

Index
=====
In SQL databases an index is a data structure which allows you to perform fast queries 
on specific columns in a table.You select the columns that you want included in the index
and run ur searches on the index- rather than on entire data set
 In DynamoDB 2 types of indexes are supported
   1.Local secondary Index
   2.Global secondary Index

1.Local secondary Index
   Can only be created when you are creating the table
   You can not add ,remover or modify later
   It has same partition key as your original table
   But different sort key
   Gives you a different view of your data organized according to alternative sort key
   Any queries based on this sort key are much faster using the index than the main table
  Partition key :User Id
  Sort Key  : account creation date
    

2.Global secondary Index
You can create it when u create the table or add it later
Different partition key as well as different sort key
So gives complet view of the data
speeds up any queries relating th this alternative partition and sort key
Partition key :email address
Sort key :last login date








Scan Vs Query API Call
========================
A Query operation finds items in a table based on the Primary key attribute and
 distinct value to search for

Eg. Select item where customer id is equal to 212 will select all the attributes of that item eg.
first name and last name email

Use an optional sort key name and value to rfine the results

if your sort key is timestamp you can refine query to select items with timestamp of last seve day

By default Query returns all the attributes for the items bu you can use Projection Expression
parameter if you want the query to only return the specific atributes you want

Eg. If you only want to see the email adddress rather than all attributes

Results are always sorted by the Sort key
Numberic Order by default ascending order
You can reverse the order by setting the ScanIndexForward parameter to false
By Default queries are eventually Consistent
you need to be explictly set the query to be strongly consistent


What is scan ?
============

A scan operation examines every item in a table
By default returns all data attributes
Use the ProjectionExpression parameter to refined the scan to only return the attribute you want




Query is more efficent than Scan
Scan dumps the entire table then filters out the values to
provide the desired result -removing unwanted data
This adds and extra step of removing the data you don't want
As the table grows ,the scan operation takes longer




DynamoDB Provisioned Throghput
===============================
DynamoDB Provisioned Throghput is measured in capcity units

When you create a table specify ur requriements in terms of read capacity units
and write capacity units.

1 * 1 write capacity unit =1 * 1 kb per second

1 * 1 read capacity unit =
1 strongly consistent read of 4kb per second 

2 * evntually consistent reads of 4 kb per second


DynamoDB Example configuration
================================
Table with 5* read capacity units and 5 write capacity units

This configuration will be able to perform 
  5* 4kb strongly consistent reads =20 kb per second
  Twice as many eventual consistent =40 kb 
  5* 1kb  writes =5kb per second

If your application reads or writes larger items it will consume more capacity units 
and will cost you more as well.


Strongly Consistent read calculation
  Your application needs to read 80 items (table  rows) per seond
  Each item 3kb in size

  You need strong consistent reads
  First Calculate how many read capacity units needed for each read
  i.e size of each item/4kb  =>3kb/4kb > 0.75 rounded (1)
  Each read will need 1*read capacity unit pere read operation
  Multiplied by the number of reads per second=80 read capacity units are needed     

Eventual Consistent read calculation
  Same calculation Divide 80/2 so u need only 40 read capacity units for eventual consistent reads.


DynamoDB :On Demand capacity

Charges apply for reading,writing and storing data

With On-demand,you don't need to specify your requirements
DynamoDB instantly scales up and down based on the activity of your application
Great for unpredictable loads
You want to pay for only what you use.

On Demand Capacity
===================
Unknon workloads
Unpredictable application traffic
You want to Pay per use model
Spiky,short lived peaks

Provisioned Capacity
====================
You can forecast read and write capacity requirements
Predictable application traffic
application traffice is consistent or increass gradually



Dynamodb accelerator (DAX)
==========================
It is a fully managed clustered in-memory cache for DynamoDB
Delivers upto a 10X read performance improvement
Microsecond performance for millions of request per second
Ideal for read HEavy and bursty workloads
e.g
    auction applications,gaming and,sistes during black Friday promotions


DAX is write-through caching service-this means data iswritten to the cache as well as 
the back end store at the same time

Allows you point your DynamoDB API calls at the DAX cluster

If the item you are quering is in the cache (cache hit).DAX returns the result to the application

How Does it work?
If the item is not available(cache miss) the DAX performs
eventually consistent GetItem operation against DynamoDB

Retrieveal of data from DAX reduces the read load on DynamoDB tables

May be able to reduce Provisioned Read Capacity

What is Not Suitable For?

Caters for Eventually Consistetn reads only-

so not suitable for applications that require Strongly Consistent reads

Write intensive applications

Applications that don not perform many read operations

Applications that do not require microsecod response times

You point your API calls to the DAX cluster instead of your table

=========================================================


Amazon Kinesis
================
Easily collect, process, and analyze video and data streams in real time


Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming

Updating Elastic Bean stalks
===============================
4 different deployment approaches

1.All at once
=============
  Service interption while you update the entire environment 
  at once .
  To rollback, perform further all at Once upgrade 

   Suitable for prod and dev when the business have a down time whenever they have updates.

Rolling
========
   Reduced capacity during deployment ,but no down time
   To roll back perform further rolling update
   

Rolling with additional batch
=================================
  Maintain Full capacity
  To roll back perform further rolling update
  
Immutable
=================================
  Prefered option for mission critical production system
  Maintain full capacity
  To rollback just delete the new instances and autoscaling group

Advanced Elastic Bean Stalk
=============================
You can customize your elastic bean Stalk environment by adding configuration files

The files are written in YAML or JSON
Files have a.config extension

The .config files are saved to the .ebextensions folder
Your .ebextensions folder must be located in the top level directory of
your application source code bundle

Two different options for launching your RDS instance

Launch within Elastic Bean Stalk
=================================
When you termicate the Elastic Bean Stalk environment database will be also terminated
Quick and easy to add your database and get started
Suitable for Dev and Test environment


Launch outside Elastic Bean Stalk
===================================
Additional configuration steps required -Security Group and connection information  
Suitable for Production environment,More flexibility
Allows connection from multiple environment
You can tear down the application stack without impacting the database

SQS
===
   It is distrubuted messaging queuing system
   Allows you to decouple componenets of an application so they
   are independent
   Pull based not push based
   Messages are 256 KB in size
   Messages can be kept in the queue from 1 minute to 14 days
   Default retention period is 14 days
   SQS guarentees that your messages will be processed at least once





Standard queues(default) provides best effort ordering message and  delivered at least once.




FIFO queues  ordering strictly preserved message delevered once
no duplicates (good for banking transactions which need to happen in strict order)

Visibility timeout
    Amount of time that the message is invisible in the SQS
    after reader picks up that message.Provided the job is   processd before visibility timeout expires 
    the message will be deleted from the queue.If job is not processed within that time the message
    will become visible again and another reader will process it.This could result in the 
    same message being delivered twice.


To prevent other consumers from processing the message again, Amazon SQS sets a visibility timeout,
a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing
the message. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. 
The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours.


    Default 30 second 
    Increase if your task takes more than 30    seond to complete
    Max 12 hours

Short polling   : returned immediately even if no messages are in the queue
===============

Long polling   : polls the queuue periodically and only returns response when 
               message is in the queue or go the timeout is reached 


SNS
====
    Amazon SNS is web service that makes it easy to set up ,operate and send the notifications from the cloud.

   It provides developers whith higly scalable,flexible and cost effective capability to publish the 
   messages from and application and immediately deliver them to the subscribers or other applications.

 SNS notifincations can also trigger the lamda functions.
 Allows yo to group multiple recipients using topics.A topic is access point for allowing  reciepents 
 to dynamically subscribe for identical copies of the same notiication
 
 To prevent messages being lost all messages published to Amazon SNS are stored 
redundantly across multiple availabilty zones.
 
 Benefits
  
   It is a push based delivery (no polling)
   Simple apis and esay integrtion with applications
   Flexible message delivery over multiple transport protocols
   Inexpensive pay as you go model with no upfront cost
   Web based  AWS management console offers the simplicity of a point and click interface

It is a scalable and highly available noification service which allows you to send
push notifications from the cloud

A variety of message formats are supported
   SMS text messages
   email
   Amazon SQS queues
   any http end point
Pub-Sub model where by users subscribe to topic
It is a push mechanisam rather than pull mechanism


Example architecture :
   A company want to send a notification to multiples customers
   could use SNS to fan out multiple messages in SQS format using dedicated SQS
   per customer

Pricing
=======
$0.50 per 1 million Amazon SNS requests
$0.06 per 1,00,000 Notification deliverables over http
$0.75 per 100 notification deliveries over SMS
$2.00 per 100,000 notification deliveries over Email


SNS and SQS
=============
Both are messaging services
SNS-Push based
SQS -Poll based (Pulls)



SNS vs SES
=============
SES is for email only
It can used for incoming and outgoing mail
It is not subscription based-You only need to know email address


SNS cates for various formats(SMS,SQS,HTTP,email) 
Push notificatios only
Pub Sub model-consumer must subscriber to atopics
You can fan out messages to large number of recipents
(eg. multiple clients each with their own SQS queue)
  
  
Elastic Load Balancing
=============================
Achieve fault tolerance for any application by ensuring scalability, performance, and security.



Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic 
across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, 
and Lambda functions.It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in
a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancing 
offers three types of load balancers that all feature the high availability, automatic 
scaling, and robust security necessary to make your applications fault tolerant.



Application Load Balancer
============================
Application Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and 
provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, 
including microservices and containers. Operating at the individual request level (Layer 7),
Application Load Balancer routes traffic to targets within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) 
based on the content of the request.


Network Load Balancer
======================
Network Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), 
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) traffic where extreme performance 
is required. Operating at the connection level (Layer 4), Network Load Balancer routes traffic
to targets within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and is capable of handling millions 
of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. Network Load Balancer is also 
optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.


Classic Load Balancer
=====================

Classic Load Balancer provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances and
operates at both the request level and connection level. Classic Load Balancer is intended 
for applications that were built within the EC2-Classic network.


Application Services
=====================

Step Function
=============
AWS Step Functions is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that makes it easier to orchestrate
multiple AWS services to accomplish tasks. Step Functions allows you to create steps in a process where
the output of one step becomes the input for another step, all using a visual workflow editor.

Api Gateway
==========
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create,
publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for 
applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services.
Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time 
two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless 
workloads, as well as web applications.

API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands 
of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access 
control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. API Gateway has no minimum fees
or startup costs. You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out 
and, with the API Gateway tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.




Simple Workflow
================
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, 
publish, maintain,monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for 
applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. 
Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time
two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless
workloads, as well as web applications.

API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands
of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access 
control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. API Gateway has no minimum fees
or startup costs. You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred 
out and, with the API Gateway tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API 
usage scales.


Amazon SWF helps developers build, run, and scale background jobs that have parallel or sequential steps. 
You can think of Amazon SWF as a fully-managed state tracker and task coordinator in the Cloud.

If your app's steps take more than 500 milliseconds to complete, you need to track the state of processing,
and you need to recover or retry if a task fails, Amazon SWF can help you.



Elastic Transcoder
==================
Amazon Elastic Transcoder is media transcoding in the cloud. It is designed to be a highly scalable, 
easy to use and a cost effective way for developers and businesses to convert (or “transcode”) media
files from their source format into versions that will playback on devices like smartphones, tablets and PCs.


Amazon Elastic Transcoder manages all aspects of the media transcoding process for you transparently 
and automatically. There’s no need to administer software, scale hardware, tune performance, or otherwise 
manage transcoding infrastructure. You simply create a transcoding “job” specifying the location of your 
source media file and how you want it transcoded. Amazon Elastic Transcoder also provides transcoding 
presets for popular output formats, which means that you don’t need to guess about which settings
work best on particular devices. All these features are available via service API, AWS SDKs and 
the AWS Management Console.

Like other Amazon Web Services products, there are no contracts or monthly commitments for using Amazon Elastic
Transcoder — you simply pay based on the minutes you need to transcode, and resolution of the content transcoded.


AWS workspace
=============
Amazon WorkSpaces is a managed, secure Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) solution. You can use Amazon 
WorkSpaces to provision either Windows or Linux desktops in just a few minutes and quickly scale
to provide thousands of desktops to workers across the globe. You can pay either monthly or hourly,
just for the WorkSpaces you launch, which helps you save money when compared to traditional 
desktops and on-premises VDI solutions. Amazon WorkSpaces helps you eliminate the complexity
in managing hardware inventory, OS versions and patches, and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI),
which helps simplify your desktop delivery strategy. With Amazon WorkSpaces, your users get a fast,
responsive desktop of their choice that they can access anywhere, anytime, from any supported device.
